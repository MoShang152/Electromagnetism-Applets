    Calculate the net B-field on a 2D grid from two long parallel wires.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    I1, I2 : float
        Currents through wire #1 and wire #2 (A). 
        Positive means +z direction, negative means -z direction.
    d : float
        Separation of wires along x-axis (wire #1 at x=-d/2, wire #2 at x=+d/2).
    grid_size : int
        Number of points in each dimension of the grid.
    extent : float
        Half-size of the region in x and y to plot (from -extent to +extent).
        
    Returns:
    --------
    X, Y : meshgrids for the x and y coordinates
